# FastSusu
#People have used susu for many years to save money for short-term goals when there was no banks or banks are not convinient. Susu is still present in many communities but is limited between families and close friends.
#How susu work?
#Group members meet on bi-weekly or monthly basis, depending on what group decides on, they all contribute euqal amount of money to reach a certain goal and one of the member recieves it. It continues until every member of the group receives their sum. 
# for example, a group of 10 members decides to do Susu for 5000 dollors, members decides to meet every two weeks and contribute $500 each. The money collected i.e $5000 ($500*10) then goes to one member. They keep continue doing so until all 10 members receives $5000 
Who decides to get the money in which cycle is based on need of each members and they decide by mutual agreements.
